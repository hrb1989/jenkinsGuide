       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Checkout') {
               steps {
                   git 'https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git'
               }
           }
           stage('Build') {
               steps {
                   sh 'make'
               }
           }
           stage('Test') {
               steps {
                   sh 'make test'
               }
           }
           stage('Deploy') {
               steps {
                   sh './deploy.sh'
               }
           }
       }

   ```

### 14. Sample readymade Pipeline Project Groovy Script for CD, FTP code deployment:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       parameters {
           string(name: 'TARGET_SERVERS', defaultValue: 'server1,server2', description: 'Comma-separated list of target servers')
       }
       stages {
           stage('Fetch from FTP') {
               steps {
                   ftpPublisher paramPublish: [configName: 'FTP_Config', transfers: [[$class: 'Transfer', remoteDirectory: '/path/on/server', sourceFiles: '**/*']], usePromotionTimestamp: false, useWorkspaceInPromotion: false, verbose: true]
               }
           }
           stage('Deploy') {
               steps {
                   script {
                       def servers = params.TARGET_SERVERS.split(',')
                       servers.each {
                           sh "scp -r build/* ${it}:/path/to/deploy/"
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   This is a simplified example; actual FTP server details, authentication, and error handling need to be implemented.

### 15. Sample readymade Pipeline Project Groovy Script for CD, environment-dependent deployment:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       parameters {
           choice(name: 'DEPLOY_ENV', choices: ['staging', 'production'], description: 'Select the target environment')
       }
       stages {
           stage('Deploy') {
               steps {
                   script {
                       if (params.DEPLOY_ENV == 'staging') {
                           // Deploy to staging
                       } else if (params.DEPLOY_ENV == 'production') {
                           // Deploy to production
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### 16. Sample readymade Pipeline Project Groovy Script for CD with conditional stages:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Build') {
               steps {
                   sh 'echo "Building..."'
               }
           }
           stage('Test') {
               steps {
                   sh 'echo "Testing..."'
               }
           }
           stage('Deploy to Staging') {
               when {
                   expression { return env.BRANCH_NAME == 'develop' }
               }
               steps {
                   sh 'echo "Deploying to Staging..."'
               }
           }
           stage('Deploy to Production') {
               when {
                   allOf {
                       branch 'master'
                       expression { return params.DEPLOY_PROD }
                   }
               }
               steps {
                   sh 'echo "Deploying to Production..."'
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   Here, the `env.BRANCH_NAME` environment variable and `params.DEPLOY_PROD` parameter are used to control the flow of the pipeline.

Please ensure you have proper error handling, security measures, and testing in place for these pipeline scripts before using them in a production environment. Each Jenkins setup may require additional configuration based on network, security, and company policy.

Running and executing Groovy scripts can be quite straightforward. Here are some ways to do it:

### On a Local Machine:

**Step 1: Install Groovy**

Before you can run Groovy scripts, you must have Groovy installed on your local machine. Here's how you can install it:

- On **Windows**:
  - Download the Groovy binary from the [official Groovy website](http://groovy-lang.org/download.html).
  - Follow the installation instructions provided.

- On **macOS** (using Homebrew):
  ```bash
  brew install groovy
  ```

- On **Linux** (using SDKMAN!):
  ```bash
  curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
  source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
  sdk install groovy
  ```

**Step 2: Write a Groovy Script**

Create a file with the `.groovy` extension, for example, `hello.groovy`, and open it in a text editor. Then, write a simple Groovy script like:

```groovy
println "Hello, Groovy World!"
```

**Step 3: Run the Script**

Open a terminal (or command prompt on Windows), navigate to the directory containing your script, and run it with the `groovy` command:

```bash
groovy hello.groovy
```

You should see the output `Hello, Groovy World!` in the terminal.

### Online Groovy Consoles:

If you do not wish to install Groovy locally, you can run Groovy scripts using an online Groovy console such as:

- [JDoodle Groovy Editor](https://www.jdoodle.com/execute-groovy-online)
- [TutorialsPoint Groovy Console](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_groovy_online.php)

With online consoles, you can write your Groovy code in the provided text area and then execute it without any local setup.

### Groovy Shell (Groovysh):

If you have Groovy installed, you can also use the interactive shell, `groovysh`, which allows you to type Groovy expressions and see the results immediately. Just type `groovysh` in your command line to start it.

### Groovy Web Console:

Another useful tool is the [Groovy Web Console](https://groovyconsole.appspot.com/), which is a web application that allows you to write and execute Groovy scripts in your browser.

### Groovy in IDEs:

For a more robust development environment, you can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code with Groovy plugins/extensions. These environments provide code highlighting, debugging tools, and more.

### Note for Jenkins Users:

When you become comfortable with Groovy, you can start applying your skills in Jenkins by writing `Jenkinsfile` scripts for pipelines. Remember that Jenkins runs on the JVM, and you'll be using Groovy scripts within the Jenkins environment, which gives you access to Jenkins-specific classes and functions.

For practice, you might also want to look into Jenkins' Script Console to run Groovy commands directly against your Jenkins instance, which can be useful for administration, diagnostics, and scripting tasks within Jenkins.

Certainly! Groovy is a powerful language with features similar to Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk. It's designed to integrate seamlessly with Java and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In Jenkins, Groovy scripts are used for writing Jenkinsfiles for Pipeline jobs, extending the Jenkins platform by writing plugins, and performing various administrative tasks through script console.

### Basics of Groovy:

- **Syntax**:
  Groovy's syntax is similar to Java's but with less boilerplate code. You don't need to define a class or method to run a simple script.

- **Variables**:
  You can define variables using `def` or with explicit types:
  ```groovy
  def myVariable = 'Hello, World!'
  String myString = 'Hello, Groovy!'
  int myNumber = 123
  ```

- **Collections**:
  Groovy makes it easy to work with lists and maps.
  ```groovy
  def myList = [1, 2, 3]
  def myMap = [name: 'Jenkins', type: 'CI/CD']
  ```

- **Control Structures**:
  Groovy supports typical control structures like if-else, for loops, and while loops.
  ```groovy
  if (myVariable == 'Hello, World!') {
      println 'Condition is true!'
  }

  for (item in myList) {
      println "Item: ${item}"
  }
  ```

- **Functions**:
  Groovy functions can be defined using the `def` keyword.
  ```groovy
  def sayHello(name) {
      return "Hello, ${name}!"
  }
  println sayHello('User')
  ```

- **Closures**:
  Groovy’s closures are similar to "lambdas" in other languages, which are essentially anonymous functions.
  ```groovy
  def greeting = { name -> println "Hello, ${name}" }
  greeting('Groovy')
  ```

### Groovy in Jenkins:

In Jenkins, Groovy is typically used in three areas:

1. **Scripted Pipeline**:
   - A DSL for defining a Jenkins job.
   - Scripted using Groovy code.
   - Runs inside a `node` block.
   ```groovy
   node {
       stage('Checkout') {
           git 'https://github.com/example/repo.git'
       }
       stage('Build') {
           sh 'make'
       }
       stage('Test') {
           sh 'make test'
       }
       stage('Deploy') {
           sh 'make deploy'
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Declarative Pipeline**:
   - A more structured and syntax-simplified version of the pipeline code.
   - Still allows for Groovy expressions.
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Build') {
               steps {
                   echo 'Building..'
               }
           }
           stage('Test') {
               steps {
                   echo 'Testing..'
               }
           }
           stage('Deploy') {
               steps {
                   echo 'Deploying...'
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Jenkins Script Console**:
   - A web-based Groovy shell that can execute Groovy scripts directly on the Jenkins controller or nodes.
   - Useful for administrative tasks and quick checks.
   - Example: Restarting all the slaves.
   ```groovy
   Jenkins.instance.slaves.each { slave ->
       println "Restarting ${slave.name}"
       slave.getComputer().disconnect()
       slave.getComputer().connect(true)
   }
   ```

### Training a Beginner:

To train a beginner in Groovy scripting for Jenkins:

1. **Understand Java Basics**: Since Groovy is built upon Java, having a basic understanding of Java can be very helpful.
2. **Learn Groovy Fundamentals**: Start with Groovy's syntax, control structures, collections, and object-oriented concepts.
3. **Practice Groovy Scripting**: Use online Groovy consoles or local Groovy installation to write and execute scripts.
4. **Read Jenkins Pipeline Documentation**: Understand the syntax and capabilities of both scripted and declarative pipelines.
5. **Write Simple Jenkinsfiles**: Start by writing basic `Jenkinsfile` scripts to build a project, run tests, and deploy artifacts.
6. **Explore Jenkins Script Console**: Use script console for reading system information, performing maintenance, and troubleshooting.

By combining Groovy knowledge with Jenkins Pipeline documentation, a beginner can gradually learn to write more complex scripts and eventually automate entire build, test, and deployment processes in Jenkins.
